Site Plan for To-Do List App with JSON Storage
1. Site Name
Site Name: TaskMaster

Reason for Selection: "TaskMaster" reflects the app's purpose of helping users manage and "master" their tasks. It is simple, memorable, and relevant to the target audience who are looking to stay organized and in control of their to-do list.

Optional Domain Availability: taskmaster-app.com (example, check availability through a domain provider)

2. Site Purpose
Purpose: The "TaskMaster" app is a simple to-do list manager that allows users to create, edit, delete, and organize their tasks. The app utilizes the browser's local storage to save tasks in JSON format, ensuring that data persists across sessions. Additionally, users can set due dates, prioritize tasks, and mark tasks as completed.

Key Features:

Task creation, editing, and deletion.

Task prioritization and due date management.

Data stored in JSON format using local storage for persistence.

Simple and intuitive interface for easy task management.

Optional reminder system for due tasks (can be added as an advanced feature).

3. Scenarios
These are common questions that a visitor to the site (target user) might ask when using the app:

How do I add a new task?

A user can input the task's name, set a due date (optional), and assign a priority level (optional). After clicking the "Add Task" button, the task will appear in the list and be stored in local storage.

Can I set reminders for tasks?

Users can set a reminder (optional feature) to be notified before a task's due date using the Notification API or browser alerts.

How do I mark a task as completed?

Tasks can be marked as completed by checking a box or clicking a "Mark as Completed" button next to each task.

Can I delete a task?

Users can easily delete a task by clicking a delete button next to the task in the task list.

4. Color Scheme
The color scheme should be simple and effective for both aesthetics and usability. It should be designed for readability and a clean look.

Primary Color: #3498db (Blue)

Usage: This color will be used for headers, buttons, and accents to create a vibrant and modern look.

Secondary Color: #2ecc71 (Green)

Usage: This color will be used for task completion buttons and accents like task priorities, or used for the task status to highlight completed tasks.

Background Color: #f4f4f9 (Light Gray)

Usage: Used as the general background color for the entire site to ensure a clean and easy-to-read interface.

Text Color: #2c3e50 (Dark Text)

Usage: This color will be used for body text, task names, and other text elements to ensure good contrast and readability.

5. Typography
The typography should be simple and readable across all devices.

Primary Font: Roboto (from Google Fonts)

Usage: This font will be used for the entire body text for easy readability.

Secondary Font (optional): Arial (fallback font)

Usage: This font will be used for fallback in case Roboto is unavailable.

Headings: Use Roboto Bold for headings to create distinction between titles and body text.

Body Text: Use Roboto Regular for general content and task descriptions.
